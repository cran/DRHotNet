\title{Creates the neighbourhood structure of a linear network}
\usage{
NeighbourhoodMatrixNetwork(network)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{- A \code{linnet} object representing a linear network structure}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{listw} object in \code{"W"} style
}
\description{
Given a linear network structure, this function creates the neighbourhood matrix ("queen" criterion) associated to it. Two segments of the network are neighbours if they share a vertex
