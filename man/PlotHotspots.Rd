\title{Plots an object obtained with \code{DiffHotspots_n_k}}
\usage{
PlotHotspots(
  X,
  hotspots,
  order_extension = NULL,
  which.plot = NULL,
  rotation_angle = 0,
  eps_image = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{- A \code{lpp} object representing a marked point pattern lying on a road network (\code{linnet} object)}

\item{hotspots}{- A set of differential risk hotspots obtained with the function \code{DiffHotspots_n_k}}

\item{order_extension}{- A natural number indicating a neighbourhood order to be used for constructing an extension of the differential risk hotspots. The summary is also given for the segments forming this extension}

\item{which.plot}{- A numeric vector indicating which differential risk hotspots to plot (according to the way they are ordered in \code{hotspots})}

\item{rotation_angle}{- A rotation angle (in degrees, from 0 to 180) to apply to the network (to improve visualization, if required). By default it is set to 0}

\item{eps_image}{- If set to \code{TRUE}, an .eps image is generated. By default it is set to \code{FALSE}}
}
\description{
This function plots a set of differential risk hotspots located along a linear network. An extension of the hotspots (including the kth order neighbourhs of the segments of the hotspots) is also plotted
